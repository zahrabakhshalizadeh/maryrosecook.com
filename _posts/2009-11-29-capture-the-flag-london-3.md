Really great fun. Forty people, two eighths of a square mile, two flags, two jails. Steal the other team&#8217;s flag and return it to your base. If you are in the other team&#8217;s territory and one of them touches you, you must go to their jail and stay there until a member of your team frees you. Other than physical violence, pretty much anything goes. Run, sneak, hide behind cars and in shadows, blend in with the public, climb fences and dive under bushes, set up diversions and coordinated attacks. [Find out more][1].
