I used to watch this when I was a child. I think my God mother gave it to me on video. The <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123122/'>programme</a> comprises four songs performed by characters from Peanuts. A few years ago, my friend, Dave, and I discovered a mutual appreciation. He even has a copy on DVD. We recorded [a cover of Lucy Says][1] in the last afternoon before I moved from Leeds to London.
