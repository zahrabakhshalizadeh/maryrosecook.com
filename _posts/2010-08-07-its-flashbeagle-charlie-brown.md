I used to watch this when I was a child.  I think my God mother gave it to me on video.  The <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123122/'>programme</a> comprises four songs performed by characters from Peanuts.  A few years ago, my friend, Dave, and I discovered a mutual appreciation.  He even has a copy on DVD.  We recorded <a href='http://maryrosecook.playmary.com/track/grrlmageddon_lucysays'>a cover of Lucy Says</a> in the last afternoon before I moved from Leeds to London.
