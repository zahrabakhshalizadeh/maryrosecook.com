I&#8217;ve been working on a large personal project for the last four months. To keep myself fresh, I&#8217;ve also done a couple of little mini projects. The first was [Tweviews][1], tiny reviews on Twitter.

I knocked up the second this weekend: [Throw Text][2], instant text storage and retrieval. I know there a lot of these things on the &#8216;net, most called Online Notepad. But my goals for Throw Text are a bit different:

1. Identical sign-up, edit and retrieve screens.  
2. Text stored as you type.  
3. Clean, clean cleanliness.

Some technical notes. Throw Text was written in [Ruby on Rails][3]. It is hosted on [Slicehost][4] for $20 a month. It is served by [Apache][5] 2 and [mod_rails][6] (aka Passenger). The data is stored in [MySQL][7]. It took longer to set up the hosting than to write the code.

So, give it a whirl: [Throw Text][2].
