Two hours later, almost to the minute, I have [read the Mac Rumours live update][1], fought off the urge to order a [MacBook Air][2] this second, listened to a [Dragbody][3] album and a [Jeremy Warmsley][4] album and switched the maryrosecook.com deployment system from a change-the-files-in-the-app-directory-by-hand approach to a fully awesome and automatic [Capistrano][5]-powered kind of thing. If you want to capify your site and you host with TextDrive, there is a good tutorial [here][6].
