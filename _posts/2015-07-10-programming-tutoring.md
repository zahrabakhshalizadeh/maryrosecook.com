Do you want to learn the basics of computer programming? I'll tutor you, one on one, for free.

My name is Mary. I've programmed professionally for ten years. I have a master's degree in computer science. I work as a teacher/mentor at the Recurse Center, a programming retreat in New York.

For the tutoring, we'll meet at a coffee shop in Manhattan for two hours. We'll go step by step through making some simple animations, and maybe a game. You won't need any prior experience, or even a computer.

Why am I doing this? First, I want to get better at teaching beginner programmers. Second, I'm making a website that teaches programming, and I want to learn how to improve it.
