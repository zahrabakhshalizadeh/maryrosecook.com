Do you want to learn the basics of computer programming? I'll tutor you, one on one, for free.

We'll meet at a coffee shop in Manhattan for two hours.  We'll go step by step through making some simple animations, and maybe a game. You won't need any prior experience, or even a computer.

Why am I doing this? First, I want to get better at teaching beginner programmers. Second, I'm making a website that teaches programming, and I want to learn how to improve it.
