Do you want to learn the basics of computer programming? I'll tutor you, one on one, for free.

We'll meet for two hours at a coffee shop in Manhattan. You’ll learn the basics of programming. We'll go step by step through making some simple animations, and maybe a game. You won't need any prior experience, or even a computer.

My name is <a href="http://maryrosecook.com">Mary Rose Cook</a>.  I’m a teacher and mentor at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, a free programming school in Manhattan. I have a master’s degree in computer science. I’ve programmed professionally for 10 years.

Why am I doing this? First, I want to get better at teaching beginner programmers. Second, I'm making a website that teaches programming, and I want to learn how to improve it.

If you're interested, please <a href="mailto:mary@maryrosecook.com">email me</a>.
