I've made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUK-b1lKEtc) of my talk, Git from the inside out.

The talk is a deep dive into the innards of Git.  It focuses on the graph structure that underpins Git and the way the properties of this graph dictate Gitâ€™s behavior. Looking at fundamentals gives you a better understanding of what Git has done, what it is doing, and what it will do.

If you'd rather digest the same information as six thousand words of prose, read my essay, [Git from the inside out](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out).
