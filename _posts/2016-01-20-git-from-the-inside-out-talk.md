I've made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUK-b1lKEtc) of my talk, Git from the inside out.

The talk is a deep dive into the innards of Git.  It focuses on the graph structure that underpins Git and the way the properties of this graph dictate Gitâ€™s behavior. It shows you how to use these properties to understand what Git has done, what it is doing, and what it will do.

If you'd rather digest the same information as six thousand words of prose, read my essay, [Git from the inside out](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out).

If you'd rather digest the same information as an implementation of Git in a thousand lines of heavily-annotated JavaScript, read my [source code for Gitlet](http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html).

If you'd rather digest the same information in an interactive workshop, [email me](mailto:mary@maryrosecook.com)!
