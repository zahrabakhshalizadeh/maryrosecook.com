[Sunset Rubdown][1] were started by Spencer Krug, more famous for his less good band, Wolf Parade.

Sunset Rubdown's second record, Shut Up I Am Dreaming, is a wonderful collection of sad songs that have unexpected melody falls that rip your heart out. The most upsetting is where, on [The Empty Threats Of Little Lord][2], Krug sings, "You snake," with such venom that you can hear the curl of his lip. That part of the song affects me so much that I have been, unsuccessfully, trying to work out who I am associating it with.

Maybe I am thinking of myself.
