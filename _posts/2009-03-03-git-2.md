I've been using [Git][1] for a while. I like it. However, it's kind of like watching [Angel Heart][2]: you get to the end and you go, "Wow." But, then, you start to recurse from the denouement and fully expand the solutions you came up with as you watched the film. Then, it becomes more like, "Whoa, that's means that&#8230;", "Oh, no! But he&#8230;", "Holy shitting fuck he had sex with&#8230;"

Explaining Git to someone produces even more of a contrast between first and subsequent reactions. The person you're explaining it to starts out like one of those people looking at a Magic Eye: "Mmmm, yeah, that's really weird." And then they get it and they leap backwards shouting, "It's a fucking 3D [pink dolphin][3]."
