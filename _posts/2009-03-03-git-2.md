I&#8217;ve been using [Git][1] for a while. I like it. However, it&#8217;s kind of like watching [Angel Heart][2]: you get to the end and you go, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; But, then, you start to recurse from the denouement and fully expand the solutions you came up with as you watched the film. Then, it becomes more like, &#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s means that&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Oh, no! But he&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Holy shitting fuck he had sex with&#8230;&#8221;

Explaining Git to someone produces even more of a contrast between first and subsequent reactions. The person you&#8217;re explaining it to starts out like one of those people looking at a Magic Eye: &#8220;Mmmm, yeah, that&#8217;s really weird.&#8221; And then they get it and they leap backwards shouting, &#8220;It&#8217;s a fucking 3D [pink dolphin][3].&#8221;
