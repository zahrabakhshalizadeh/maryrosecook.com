In March, I posted [What I've been working on][1]. In it, I showed four images of [Empty Black][2], the game I was making. At that point, I was still planning for it to be driven by musical puzzles where you played tunes to open doors. Since then, it has turned into a game of three parts: deft jumping, tactile combat and block-throwing puzzles.

[Play the game][3].

Watch the trailer:
