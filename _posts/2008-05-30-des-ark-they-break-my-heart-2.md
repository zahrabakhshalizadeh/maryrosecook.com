I have always really liked Des Ark but, for some reason, for the last week, I have not been able to stop watching their videos on YouTube.

They make me want to cry, Aimee&#8217;s guitar playing makes me boil with envy, and their two delivery methods (crushing rock and crushing acoustic) leave me lost in admiration.
