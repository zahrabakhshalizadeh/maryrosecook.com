I keep on finding these little notes inside the books on my shelves. Each note describes why Alice likes the enclosing book, what it means to her, why she thought I&#8217;d like it, why she wanted me to read it.

About two years, Alice and I had a correspondence. She was putting together a cassette of spoken word performances and, coincidentally, I&#8217;d recently read some of my own short stories into the little microphone on my laptop and played the recordings back out to a tape deck.

We got to talking via email, initially about the tape, but increasingly about our lives and our favourite bands and our dreams and our Mums and our teddy-bears and and our sexual identities. We imagined each other into our walks and nights out and crafternoons. Emails developed into letters and letters grew into parcels; parcels of books and CDs and little sketches and home-made stickers and notes.

We kept up our correspondence for about a year, but our letters dwindled, and then stopped. She got a new girlfriend, I started seeing a new boy.

But each time I find one of those notes, I go back to that time, and feel how I felt.
