Some friends and I were talking about delays on The London Underground. Someone rather heartless was complaining about the people who choose to throw themselves onto the tracks at rush hour. We got to talking about delays that result from, &#8220;A person being taken ill on a train.&#8221; From there, we started doing calculations to determine whether it was more utilitarian to let someone die than delay thousands of people&#8217;s journeys.

Assumptions:

  * x people have their journey delayed.
  * A person being taken ill on a train results in a journey delay of half an hour per traveller.
  * The person gets taken ill on the Northern Line.
  * The ill person is of [average age][1] (39) and lives clean. [Thus][2], they have a life expectancy of 88.
  * Ignore leap days.
  * There are [206,734,000][3] journeys made per annum on the Northern Line.
  * On this day, 566,395 will use the Northern Line.

Calculations:

ill person rest of life > 0.5 * x  
429240 hours > 0.5 * x  
858480 > x

So, if x, the number of travellers who are delayed, is more than 858,480, it is better to let the person die in a corner than disrupt the transport service. 

The good news is that even if every single person who was going to travel on the Northern Line that day were on it at that moment, it would still be worth doing the decent thing.
