Tiny reviews on [Twitter][1].

How artfully can you describe your impression of a song or a movie, a book or an album? There is no space for value judgements, no room for, &#8220;this sucks&#8221;. Just tell us something interesting. We want to see the inner life of this piece of art. We want you to make us care about it. 

  * The Wire Series 4 &#8230; A satisfying meal and a great, rippling flood of causation.
  * For Whom The Bell Tolls, Hemingway &#8230; Written close to the ground, to the tongue &#8211; at the contact points between man and world.
