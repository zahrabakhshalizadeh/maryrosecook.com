The external monitor is not on because, when I said to the guy in the Apple Store, &#8220;All the cables I need are included, right?&#8221;, instead of answering, &#8220;No, they&#8217;re not. You&#8217;ll need to buy a special adapter&#8221;, he, either lying or mis-informed, said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;.

This is the first time I&#8217;ve had a proper keyboard and mouse for my laptop. The big joke is, I keep on reaching over them to get to the inbuilt trackpad and keyboard.
