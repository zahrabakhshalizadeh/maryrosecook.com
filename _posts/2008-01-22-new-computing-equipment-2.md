The external monitor is not on because, when I said to the guy in the Apple Store, "All the cables I need are included, right?", instead of answering, "No, they're not. You'll need to buy a special adapter", he, either lying or mis-informed, said, "Yes".

This is the first time I've had a proper keyboard and mouse for my laptop. The big joke is, I keep on reaching over them to get to the inbuilt trackpad and keyboard.
