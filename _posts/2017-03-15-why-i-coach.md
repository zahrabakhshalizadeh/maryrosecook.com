I coach at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a programming bootcamp.  I love it.

In this essay, I'll talk about some of my favourite parts of coaching.  For each one, I'll talk about how my work supports a learning goal at Makers.  And I'll talk about how the Makers environment supports this learning goal.

### Giving as little help as possible

At Makers, developers lead their own learning.  This lets them follow their curiosity.  It lets them learn in their own style.  It lets them learn at their own pace.

I help support self-led learning.  Sometimes, a developer may ask me for help.  I love trying to identify the tiniest nudge that will get them.  Sometimes, we'll have a [Socratic dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method).  Sometimes, I'll suggest they diagram their current understanding of their problem to help uncover wrong connections.  My goal is to minimise my help so I avoid robbing them of a learning opportunity.

The environment also helps support self-led learning.  Developers work on challenges that are designed as rich playgrounds to explore programming topics and practice programming skills.  Developers work on team projects where they choose both what they work on and how they structure their work.  All the help in the environment is design to be as self-led as possible: pairing, meditating, Googling.

### Debugging learning processes

At Makers, a developer arrives as one person and leaves as a different person.  In order to learn as much as possible, they have to change their working and learning processes.

I help support developers as they improve their processes.  I run weekly surgeries.  Developers discuss programming struggles they've had.  A struggle is often described as a problem with a programming concept.  Through discussion, we try and uncover the skills and behaviours that are the actual cause of the struggle.  For example, the struggle description might be: "I find it hard to get RSpec syntax right".  Through discussion, it emerges that the developer is trying to memorise syntax piece by piece.  I might suggest they try to build their skill of mentally parsing syntax as larger, meaningful units.  Or, the struggle description might be: "I don't understand database relations".  Through discussion, it emerges that the developer has spent a lot of time reading.  We talk about how learning by doing is essential, and that they could modify their approach to include the behaviour of trying stuff out in a REPL.

The environment helps support developers as they improve their processes.  Developers learn new processes from their pair partners, the curriculum, skills workshops and group project work.

### Being a role model

At Makers, we help developers aspire to become better programmers.

I help support this aspiration to become a better programmer.  A developer who was exploring functional programming asked me what programming language would help him explore further.  I took great pleasure in suggesting Clojure.  It's wonderful to be able to share the things I'm excited about.  If a developer asks me for help with a programming problem, I might show them a cool technique, or talk through how I built my intuition for what the problem is.  It's great being able to share techniques from one craft practitioner to another.  Sometimes, a developer will ask how I started making [games](http://emptyblack.com), or how I got a job at [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com), or how I made a [programming language](http://codelauren.com).  It feels great to be able to give them advice.

The environment helps support this asipiration to become a better programmer.  We recommend books and talks by expert programmers.  By pairing every day, developers frequently work with people who are better than them, giving them a competence to learn from and aim for.  By encouraging varied projects (from a VR city-builder to an arithmetic interpreter written in Haskell), the environment becomes a community of developers who inspire each other.

### Getting better at learning

At Makers, I spend my whole day steeped in our environment.  I get to learn about educational psychology.  I get to think about learning all the time.  I get to reflect on my processes and improve them.

Every time I help someone learn, I improve my own ability to learn.

### Summary

In this essay, I've talked about some of the goals at Makers.  And I've talked about how I help support these goals.  And I've talked about how the environment helps support these goals.

And here's my greatest joy.  As a coach, I'm a part of the environment.  But I also get to design the environment.
