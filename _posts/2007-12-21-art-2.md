In Held, a track by Fakes, Billie says &#8220;This is not a piece of art. This is my life.&#8221; What&#8217;s the difference?

When John Congleton of The Paper Chase put his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s break-up answerphone message on Young Bodies Heal Quickly, You Know, was his relationship with the girl already burnt out, or was he stamping on its embers?

Sunset Rubdown&#8217;s song, The Taming Of The Hands That Came Back To Life: &#8220;She said my sails are flapping in the wind. I said, Can I use that in a song? She said, I mean the end begins. I said, I know, can I use that too?&#8221; Was her reply altered by his artistic request?

What would happen if one subjugated everything to art? What if I revealed some secret things in order to write a great article, and in the process I sacrificed relationships with people I know? Or, what if I spent all my time making the best album in the world, only to emerge and find that the things I had written about were gone?
