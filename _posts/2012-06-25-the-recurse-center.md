I am spending the summer in New York City. I am attending [the Recurse Center][1], a three month programme where the aim is to make yourself a better programmer. As a student, I spend most of my time sitting in a room with other clever people, either collaborating or working alone on open source projects. I am creating [Isla][2], a programming language for children, and an accompanying environment for using Isla to write old school text adventure games.
