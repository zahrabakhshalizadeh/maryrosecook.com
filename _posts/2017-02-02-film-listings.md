I used to love Google Movies.  It was a site that listed the films showing nearby.  For some films, there was a handy link to the film's IMDB page, or its trailer. Unfortunately, it was taken down a few months ago.  So I built my own.

It lets me find out more about a film I haven't heard of.  It lets me quickly scan to find something to see in the next few days.  And it lets me find out about that one random screening of Taxi Driver happening at 9.40pm on a Tuesday in three weeks' time.
