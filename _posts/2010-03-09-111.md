I have just added my first Playmary track that [includes an image as the comment][1]. I have no idea why I haven't done this before.

This evening, I got off the U-Bahn at GÃ¶rlitzer Bhf. and My Hometown by Bruce Springsteen came on my headphones and I looked down the platform and saw the clear, twilight Berlin sky and the sun falling out of the sky. I stood a moment to take a photograph.
