Snow Leopard is a cute name for the next release of OS X, but there are two problems with [the theory][1]. First, if you are not a Mac fan, it is difficult to discern the relationship between Snow Leopard and Leopard. Which is newer? Do I need one to install the other? Who knows? Second, it has been [reported][2] that [banners reading "OS X Leopard"][3] are hanging in Moscone West, ready for WWDC. Why tout Leopard when you're going to announce Snow Leopard?
