Michael Mann has always given great attention to detail in his films: getting people to train his actors to behave like [convicts][1], [capturing the light of sodium street lamps properly][2], having [his armed characters check chamber][3].

"We have full-time people who just show customers the code, or look at other specifications, and things of that nature."

"burn rates, ignition propensities, things of this nature."

The first quote is from a Bill Gates [interview][4] in 1986. The second is one of Jeffrey Wigand's lines in The Insider.

Both quotes include the phrase, "thing of [this/that] nature." When I read the interview with Gates, that phrase stuck out as something that only a precise person, an engineer, would say. And precision is Wigand's defining characteristic.
