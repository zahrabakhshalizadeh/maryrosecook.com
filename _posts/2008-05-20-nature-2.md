Michael Mann has always given great attention to detail in his films: getting people to train his actors to behave like [convicts][1], [capturing the light of sodium street lamps properly][2], having [his armed characters check chamber][3].

&#8220;We have full-time people who just show customers the code, or look at other specifications, and things of that nature.&#8221;

&#8220;&#8230;burn rates, ignition propensities, things of this nature.&#8221;

The first quote is from a Bill Gates [interview][4] in 1986. The second is one of Jeffrey Wigand&#8217;s lines in The Insider.

Both quotes include the phrase, &#8220;thing of [this/that] nature.&#8221; When I read the interview with Gates, that phrase stuck out as something that only a precise person, an engineer, would say. And precision is Wigand&#8217;s defining characteristic.
