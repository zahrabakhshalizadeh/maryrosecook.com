About a week ago, Kanen Flowers interviewed me on his show, [Scruffy Thinking][1]. I am very honoured. We talked about [my latest record][2], using [emacs][3], [Pistol Slut][4], Kanen&#8217;s alien snuff movie, [BBEdit][5], dressing like a teenaged boy and landing in Bangkok for a two day layover and only finally leaving a year and a half later. To listen, [go to the Scruffy Thinking podcast on iTunes][6]. Here is a [post about the show on the Scruffy Thinking site][7].
