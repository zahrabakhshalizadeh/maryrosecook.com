Some people think that programmers are like artists<sup>1</sup> and others think they are like designers and can, at their best, be like craftsmen<sup>2</sup>.

Sense and Sensibility, published in 1811, is still widely read and praised. A beautiful chair carved a hundred years ago can still be admired and sat upon today. The tin can, invented in 1810<sup>3</sup>, remains the best method of cheap, long-term food storage. Thus, there are examples of pieces of art, craftsmanship and design that have longevity.

However, do the fruits of hacking have the same longevity? I am confident that, however good it is, no one will be using the current version of my dating web site in ten years' time. In fact, the same could be said of any of today's programs and web sites.

Hacking, then, is closest to design because both methods are iterative, whereas artistry and craftsmanship are not. Novels are written, revised and then published. Chairs are carved, adjusted and then sold. In contrast, successful programs and web sites do not remain static, they are improved. The tin cans we use now are significantly different from the ones made in 1810. Thus, the difference between hacking and design, and art and craftsmanship, is that, with the former, stasis means death.

Will this change as hacking matures? It hasn't changed for design. Design meets a specific, current need. Art and craftsmanship soothe more general, perennial desires: feeling vicarious sadness, or taking the weight off one's feet.

Why are designers and hackers happy making things that will not outlive them? Perhaps the pleasure in the work is enough. Or perhaps the urge for contemporary approval is greater than the urge for longevity. But it still makes me sad that I am pouring my creativity onto the ground so that it will nourish the grass for a little while longer.
