"In trench warfare five things are important: firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy. In winter on the Zaragoza front they were important in that order."

- Homage To Catalonia, George Orwell.

At hack days seven things are important: wi-fi, power, coffee, food, comfort, warmth, sleep. In spring at Open Hack London they were  
important in that order.
