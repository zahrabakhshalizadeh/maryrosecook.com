[Pistol Slut][1] is a 2D side-scrolling shoot-em-up platformer that I am writing in JavaScript. The game is displayed by a [Canvas element][2]. It works in [Google Chrome][3], [Safari][4] and [Firefox][5] in theory, but not Internet Explorer.

### Demo

The most recent vaguely stable version will always be available at [pistolslut.com][1].

### Framework

I use [The Render Engine][6] by Brett Fattori. It's a fabulous framework that handles the basics of rendering graphics and sprites to the Canvas element, moving objects, collision detection, animation and level loading.

### Code

The Pistol Slut [code][7] is open source and available on GitHub. It would be a good reference for anyone who wants to learn about advanced capabilities of The Render Engine that aren't covered in the demos that come with the framework: animated sprites, level object loading and enemies.

### Features so far

A scrolling background, running, jumping, shooting, muzzle flash, bullet ricochets, enemies, snow, animated sprites, scrolling Orwellian signs.
