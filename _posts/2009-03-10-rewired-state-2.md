Last Saturday, I went to [Rewired State][1], a hackday where people made useful apps that use government data. The Guardian hosted us and gave us delicious free food. We got some free beer in the evening, too.

I did an app called [Voxpomp][2] that lets you search statements made by MPs in Parliament and then cross-reference the results with the news stories of the time.

It was a great day - lots of nice people and interesting conversations. I would love to see a Dewired State that was about using technology to let people build their own data sources and communities away from the government.

You can see all the hacks on the [Rewired State project page][3]. My favourites were:

* [One Click Organisations][4]. Answer a few questions and the legal framework for your organisation will be drawn up. You can also use the app to maintain your members list and propose and vote on motions. I kind of wish the app could work outside of the assumption of a voting democracy, but it is only in its early stages.

* [Section 44][5]. A place to document instances where people were stopped and searched under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act.
