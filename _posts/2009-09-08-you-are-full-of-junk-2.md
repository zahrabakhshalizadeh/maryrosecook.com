The words to a [song][1] by Stand, a hardcore band:

You are full of junk and junk fills your desires, but we know it&#8217;s easier to sit in a comfy chair with an ice cool beer and a kitsch pink horizon of how your life might take some form. Junk is cheap, junk is holiday romance, junk is beer and T.V. Junk is playtime. Junk is once in a blue moon in Hollywood U.S.A. Junk is a coffee shop, a bunch of actors and a monkey. Junk is bland and junk is your future, should you let junk into your life.

They talk about what they mean on the [words page][2] of their website.
