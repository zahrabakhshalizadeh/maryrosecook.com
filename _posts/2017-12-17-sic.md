I want to help foster the community of people in London who are interested in the dynamic medium / tools for thought / interactive simulations for creation or understanding.

Here is a hopelessly narrow set of example projects:

* [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366)
* [Hypercard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard)
* [Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad)
* [Dynamicland](https://twitter.com/Dynamicland1/status/935250882752528384)
* [Max/MSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAtYht4QVnA)
* [Seymour](https://harc.github.io/seymour-live2017/)
* [Subtext](https://vimeo.com/106073134)
* [Eve](http://witheve.com/)

A possible first step.  I'll arrange a meetup.  At the meetup, I'll give a brief talk that provides an overview of some of the interesting projects that I know of.  Around the room, there will be posters that give more information about each project.  These posters could attract groups of people who might discuss the project, or even get out a laptop and work together on trying it out.

This is just a set of initial bad ideas.  If you have thoughts about how I could make them better, I'd love you to email me at <a href="mailto:mary@maryrosecook.com">mary@maryrosecook.com</a> or send me a reply on Twitter.  Thanks!
