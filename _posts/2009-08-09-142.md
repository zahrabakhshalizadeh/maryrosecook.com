On Friday night, I programmed and came up with [Switch off the light before you leave][1] and my Mum watched the period drama, [The Forsyte Saga][2], on ITV Watch Again. The Forsytes would suffer horrendous misfortune and dish out utter nastiness, but, then, every fifteen minutes, they would forget their troubles, go to a raucous disco and a man would shout at them about how they should be drinking Bacardi.
