Several years ago, my friend, Nick, and I were doing some late night joinery at [The Common Place][1]. The building had failed its fire safety inspection and so we were making mini atriums around each entrance to hold fire doors. Nick was telling me about this amazing book by a chap called Derrick Jensen. The theme that is prominent in my mind is how you could use a special language to communicate with a duck and reconcile it to its death. Several years later, my ungirlfriend began talking to me about the amazing Jensen. She was dismissive of One Quack For Yes, Two For No (or whatever it&#8217;s called), but was in love with his magnum opus, [Endgame][2]. I scoffed. I sneered. I wheeled out the one quack joke for the seventeenth time this year. Unfortunately for my credibility, today I find myself entranced by [Jensen&#8217;s video about Endgame][3].
