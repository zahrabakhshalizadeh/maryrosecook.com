I have just released [Glazz][1], my new JavaScript library. It models vision in a 2D world. It has a built in raytracer that will tell you if one object in the world can see another object in the world. I used it in [Empty Black][2] and a game I will never release called Death Squad. It worked pretty well.

The code is open source under the MIT license. You can get it from [Github][3] or [npm][4].
