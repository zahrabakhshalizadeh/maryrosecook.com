Theresa, the lovelz ladz who is putting Matt and I up in Berlin and acting as our tour guide, advised me that Germans are sick of people sazing Ich Bin Ein Berliner because thez&#8217;ve heard it a lot before.

We are having lots of fun in Germanz. Zesterdaz, I went to meet Theresa after she had finished Uni. Unfortunatelz, Matt took the map so I had to ask mz waz there. I said a lot of &#8220;Etschooldigong&#8221;, followed bz mz two-second guide proceeding to conduct matters entirelz in English.

Must go to breakfast with Theresa-resz and Mattieu.
