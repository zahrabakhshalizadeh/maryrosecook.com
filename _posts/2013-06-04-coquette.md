I've just released [Coquette][1], a micro framework for JavaScript games. It handles collision detection, the game update loop, keyboard input and canvas rendering. I wrote it in a panic when, two hours before the deadline of April's [Ludum Dare][2], I discovered that entries cannot use closed source library code.
