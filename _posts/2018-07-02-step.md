Use [Step](http://step.maryrosecook.com) to get a more precise understanding of how code executes.

You see a code listing.  You click on the part of the code that you think will execute next. Then you click on the part of the code that you think will execute after that.  And so on.

This is just a proof of concept.  You can't enter your own code, but I plan to change that.
