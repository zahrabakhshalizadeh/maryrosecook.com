1. Players stand in a circle, each an arm&#8217;s length apart from their neighbours.

2. Someone shouts, &#8220;One! Two! Three! Ninja!&#8221;

3. On, &#8220;Ninja!&#8221;, the players adopt a ninja-like pose and remain still.

4. The person who counted everyone in now makes their first move. Their aim is to use their hand to touch the hand of another player, thus killing them. The player&#8217;s move must be made in one smooth motion. They may only take one a maximum of one step. The player being attacked may move their upper body in defence.

5. The next player then makes their move, and so on around the circle.
